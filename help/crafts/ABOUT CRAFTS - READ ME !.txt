After 1 or 2 minutes, reclaim your crucible and empty the depleted materials (into a tank to keep it or onto the ground to destroy it). 
After that, deposits should still be in your crucible. Place your crucible onto a heating chamber, fill the crucible with a water bucket and power the chamber with some combustibles.
After another minute or two, water should be evaporated and crystals should have popped out of the crucible as items. After all these steps, your crucible should be empty.
