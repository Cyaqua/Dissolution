# DISSOLUTION 0.7

## States Of Soul Update

#### Removal of:

- Glass jar
- Passeress shrine
- Purification effect
- Weak faeries

#### Addition of:

-         States of Soul (abbreviated "SoS") system: States of Soul defines how you will be able to exit your soul state after death. For now, there is only one available, but more will be added in the future, as a part of modules. It is important to note that a player can’t stack States of Soul: only one can be active at a time, and therefore, accepting a new State of Soul means losing the previous one you had. Not having a SoS will ensure you get the vanilla death. This update adds two States of Soul:
     -         Strong Soul: This SoS is the most basic Dissolution has to offer. Upon death, you have the choice to stay on this world as a soul. If this option is chosen instead of a simple respawn, your soul and body splits, resulting in you becoming a ghost. However, you have no way to regain a body. In order to become tangible again, you will have to "suicide" as a soul by pressing the "Fade away" button. This will result in bringing the Game Over screen and make you reappear on the world. Since this SoS is obtained at death, its icon will not show until you are a soul.
     -         Lich Cursed Soul: Upon death, you become a ghost, in a similar fashion to Strong Soul (without the option to choose). The only way to regain a body is by possessing an undead mob (zombie, skeleton, etc...). Once you have a new body, you will share its strengths and weaknesses. To become a player again, you will have to use the Regeneration effect. (Note: The SoS is currently unobtainable through survival means, but can be obtained by using the command ``/dissolution sos lich``)
-         Module system: In a similar fashion to Quark and BetterWithMods, Dissolution now possesses a module system. Modules be activated or de-activated for an optimal customisation, and for most of cases, they will concern a SoS and what orbits around it. For extra customisation, modules regroup features that can be independently toggled or not. Three modules and features will be implemented with this update: 
     -         Elysian:
          -         Faeries
          -         Will o' Wisps
          -         Soul Glass and Soul Glass panes
          -         Soul bottles
          -         Faerie dust
     -         Azure:
          -         Strong Soul SoS
     -         Jade:
          -         Lich Cursed SoS
          -         Coffins
-         Event support: Event support has been added and will be used in order to organize future events. These events will require the latest version of the mod to be played, and will be part of modules as features that can be turned on or off, whether or not you want to participate in them. They will grant special and unique rewards, if the corresponding module is enabled.

#### New items:

-         Empty soul bottle: Crafted like normal bottles except with soul glass, they are used to capture will o’ wisps and faeries. Right-clicking with a soul bottle in hand results in releasing the content (can't be placed).
-         Will o’ wisp in a soul bottle
-         Faerie in a soul bottle
-         Faerie dust: Obtained by slashing a Faerie. Serves as an alternative to ghast tears. (Note: if disabled, Faeries can't be slashed)

#### New blocks:

- Soul glass: Obtained by putting in a furnace soul sand, soul glass is a new decoration block that players in soul state can’t get through, unlike normal glass.
- Soul glass panes: Same as soul glass blocks, panes of glass that don’t let players in soul mode get through. 

#### New entities:

- Soul faerie: When a faerie and a wisp are both close to each other (at least 4 blocks close), they will attract each other, and combine into a soul faerie.When collected (by just approaching her), she turns into a normal faerie and triggers the state of soul changing dialogue. The player can then choose to acquire the Strong Soul state of soul or get rid of its state of soul and return to the vanilla death. After a player has used a soul faerie, the player has a ten in-game days cool down during which he cannot collect soul faeries(in order to avoid cheesing).

#### Miscellaneous:

- Possession system rewrite: The undead mob possession system has been entirely rewritten, in order to fix the problems it had and make it overall cleaner and better.
- Regeneration now works on undead players as Purification, the previous effect has consequently been removed.
- Faerie aura: Faeries will now affect the player when close to them, granting a constant regeneration effect when staying near. They no longer just touch the player and get weak. Regeneration stacks up to regeneration 5, at a rate of one level per Faerie.
- SoS Icon: When opening inventory, you can see your current SoS icon. Hovering it will bring the name and tooltip of it.
- Fade away in soul: As a soul, you can now "Fade away" by pressing the corresponding button under your SoS icon. This will result in a Game Over as a soul, and a respawn with no SoS.
