# DISSOLUTION 0.6

## Tabula Rasa Update

#### Addition of:

- Upon death, your soul gets extracted from your body if you chose to have a strong soul. In this soul state, you appear as a tinted transparent version of your skin, along with gaining the ability to fly and go through non-full blocks.Being non material, you can’t break, place, or collect any item or block. You can still however interact with some elements (doors, levers, buttons…).
- If in soul state, in order to reclaim a physical body, you will have to find a new functional body. For that, you can “steal” the body of an undead mob by right clicking it. That comes with all the advantages of the specific mob you control(slowness arrows from strays for example), but be careful, because that also implies you get his weaknesses (burning in the sunlight for example).
- Potion effect, Rebirth: Gradually transforms a lich player into a living player (heart by heart), at the rate of 1 heart per second. 

#### New items:

- Glass jar: Crafted with glass, these jars are used to capture wisps and faeries. Can be placed as a decoration by shift-right-clicking on the top of a block.
- Wisp in a bottle
- Faerie in a bottle

#### New blocks:

- Coffins: Used to skip the day like beds are used to skip the night, but can only be used by undead players. Available in various style and materials, for rustic or classy vampires alike.
  - Stone burial
  - Wooden coffin
  - Obsidian coffin: “Locked from the inside.” Resists to explosions.


- Passeress shrine: Crafted with iron, it represents the vision of an angel, mistress of the souls. Right clicking a Passeress shrine with a wisp in a bottle will grant the option to change whether or not you have a strong soul.

#### New entities:

- Wisps: Wisps (or Will-o’-the-wisp) are strange blue flames randomly roaming in the world at night and tend to appear in swamps. They can be captured into a glass jar by just approaching them.
- Faeries: Faeries (or fairy) are creatures usually roaming in forest and flower biomes.They go out during the day and can be captures into a glass jar by just approaching them. Their presence grants regeneration I, effective for all living creatures or players. If the player is an undead and approaches one, the faerie will start purifying his body (the undead hearts get gradually covered by player hearts at a peaceful mode regeneration rate). After this is done, the faerie loses some energy, resulting in her losing the ability to heal or regenerate during some time.
