# DISSOLUTION 0.7

## States Of Soul Update

#### Removal of:

- Glass jar
- Passeress shrine
- Purification effect
- Week faeries

#### Addition of:

-         States of Soul: States of Soul defines how you will be able to exit your soul state after death. For now, there is only one available, but more will be added in the future. It is important to note that a player can’t stack States of Soul:only one can be active at a time, and in the future, accepting a new State of Soul will mean losing the previous one you had.
     -         Strong Soul: Allows you to possess undead mobs in order to regain a body.
-         New possession system: The possession system has been entirely rewritten, in order to fix the problems it had and make it overall cleaner and better.
-         Regeneration now works on undead players as Purification, the previous effect has therefore been removed.
-         Faerie aura: Faeries will now affect the player when close to them, granting a constant regeneration effect when staying near. They no longer just touch the player and get weak. Regeneration stacks up to regeneration 5, at a rate of one level per Faerie.

#### New items:

-         Empty soul orb: Crafted like normal bottles except with soul glass, they are used to capture will o’ wisps and faeries. Right-clicking with a soul bottle in hand results in releasing the content (can't be placed).
-         Will o’ wisp in a soul bottle
-         Faerie in a soul bottle
-         Faerie dust: Obtained by slashing a Faerie with a sword, this dust can be used as an alternative to ghast tears, in order to brew regeneration potions.

#### New blocks:

- Soul glass: Obtained by putting in a furnace soul sand, soul glass is a new decoration block that players in soul state can’t get through, unlike normal glass.
- Soul glass panes: Same as soul glass blocks, panes of glass that don’t let players in soul mode get through. 

#### New entities:

- Soul faerie: When a faerie and a wisp are both close to each other (at least 4 blocks close), they will attract each other, and combine into a soul faerie.When collected (by just approaching her), she turns into a weak faerie and triggers the state of soul changing dialogue. The player can then choose to acquire the Strong Soul state of soul or get rid of its state of soul and return to the vanilla death. After a player has used a soul faerie, the player has a ten in-game days cool down during which he cannot collect soul faeries(in order to avoid cheesing).
